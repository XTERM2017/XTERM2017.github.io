    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px"> Part of the play I am working on is about leaving some spaces bare-- recognizing that not every question has an answer. We must grapple with whether or not we are ok with leaving some things empty, unfinished. New York, however, does not leave anything to be discovered. It seems as though every square inch is full, full of life, full of culture, full of passion. And those few spaces that are up for grabs? They are snatched up without leaving the time to grapple with what can or can’t be there. New York is full.</th>

  <tr>
    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px"> Yes, of course, there is the hustle and bustle of population and traffic. There are many conversations happening in many languages when you walk on the street. On the subway, though, there is a severe lack of man-made noise. It is like one giant, awkward carpool where you don’t want to look at or talk to the other people there. The silence is occasionally pierced by a couple of friends trying to talk without seeming pushy. But overall, the subway, and the unfamiliar New York, is quiet.</th>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px"> It is incredible to me how many people I meet who have lived here since birth. In Richmond, I feel like the people who aren’t either incredibly rich with old Richmond money or too poor to get out of Richmond can’t wait to leave the city. We want to explore a whole new world beyond good ol’ RVA. Here in New York, for a lot of people, it seems, moving out of the family home is the big adult adventure. I wonder if when you grow up in a city that is less confining, and more liberal, it is easier to grow up and grow old there. Or maybe it is simply because I meet people involved in theatre, and when you work on theatre and live in New York, there’s nowhere to go but down. Whatever the reason, New York is for lifers.

  <tr>
    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px"> I am not usually a big fan of the North because I am use to the kindness and manners of the South. While New York sure doesn’t have the manners that were imprinted in me in my Southern raising, they do have the kindness. I can talk to people on the streets and they smile and make small talk. People are looking for common ground and want to help when you look lost. I never thought Northerners were awful people, but I did find it surprising how much Southern hospitality they have. So, after all, New York is Southern, although, to my chagrin, they don’t automatically assume your iced tea should be sweet.

    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px">It is a breath of fresh air to walk around and see people of all different races, religions, and sexualities that aren’t immediately insulted because of their looks or actions. That’s not to say there isn’t more work to be done, but I love being able to walk down the street next to people so different than I am and not hear other people’s rude remarks on how they dress or whose hand they’re holding. Out of all of New York’s beautiful attributes, I think that is my favorite. New York accepts what is different and doesn’t force conformity.

  <tr>
    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px"> Night owls are a regular in New York. It’s not just tourists trying to cram in a little more time in Times Square. Apartment lights are on with people working rapidly on laptops inside. People are taking dogs for walks, and couples are on benches in the park. All around there are people awake and ready for adventures and work. Being someone who is far from a morning person, I love that New York has so many people up and ready-to-go late at night.

  <tr>
    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px"> During the day there is the natural light, but at night the city is just as bright. Apartment lights and street lamps light the less popular areas. Bright ads and news zippers illuminate Times Square. My favorite source of light? The Broadway Marquees. The light from shows makes me so happy because I want to be somewhere where there are so many theatres and shows available. I want to see each one that I pass lit up in the night. New York’s bright lights remind me of my love of the theatre.

  <tr>
    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px"> Everywhere I went there were people who knew each other. There were choruses of “Hello” and “How have you been?” There is a certain anonymity to New York, and looking at the amount of people there compared to the amount of people we ran into who John knew, it is clear that many people roaming the streets don’t have connections to one another. Nevertheless, there is an odd feeling of connectedness when we ran into multiple people we knew every outing we went on.
