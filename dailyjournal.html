    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px"> I met with Lynn today to discuss her work in the theatre and tour a bunch of local theatres. I learned about Lynn’s transition from acting to costuming to working at St. Catherine’s, which was very interesting. We toured a lot of theatres: Willow Lawn VA Rep, the Quill Theatre, and the November theatre. I met some of her friends, and I took an in depth look at the costuming department at the November. I really enjoyed seeing their organization and the designs for Airline Highway.</th>

    <th style="color:#001a33; font-size: 20px"> Today was very interesting! I met with Madeline Hurley, a PR representative for VA Rep. She gave me a very in depth tour of the November and introduced me to A TON of people. I got to talk to people in the box office, education office, lighting, set construction and painting, accounting, marketing, and directing. I met with Chase and got some good advice on how to handle professional directing, and I learned a lot from Madeline about the general theatre program. I found her job much more interesting than I thought I would, and I got to sit in on one of their marketing meetings. Seeing all she did for the shows, and how she melded her love of theatre with a steadily paying career, really gave me hope for my future in theatre.</th>

  <th style="color:#001a33; font-size:20px"> Day one of x-term was a success! I left RVA on a train at 8:18am, and then I arrived in NYC at 2:30pm. On the train ride up I read Six Degrees of Separation and watched a trailer for Straight Outta Compton and some of West Wing, both of which star leads of Six Degrees. I met with John in New York, and we came back to his apartment. Then, we walked his dogs and got ready for the opening of Sunday in the Park with George. That show was absolutely phenomenal! The music was incredible (and I got to sit with Stephen Sondheim), and the set design/electronics were great! It really made me think about whether I should go into set design for a living. I also got to meet a ton of John’s friends: Kristen, Laurie Ann, Halle, Emily, Donna, Jim, and so many more! We saw the director (Trip Cullman) and lead (John Benjamin Hickey) of Six Degrees as well. After the premiere, which I walked into on a red carpet, we got to stop by a really cool after party at the New York Public Library. Overall, it was an incredible day!

  <th style="color:#001a33; font-size:20px"> Day two was great! I got to sit in on auditions at Lincoln Center for understudies of Six Degrees. Man, were those actors/actresses good! They were all so talented! I met the producers, Stuart Thompson and Tim Levy, and the casting director and assistant casting director, Daniel Swee and Camille. I also met Annie, who co-edits a Lincoln Center magazine with John. Then, we went to MoMA and saw some dada, picasso, and Russian exhibits. We went out to lunch at a Hawaiian spot called PokeSpot, and then came home. John worked on writing, and I worked on coding. I only really spent 4.5 or 5 hours on the x-term stuff today (auditions, lunch, and coding), but I’ll be going to a show tomorrow to make up for the last hour or so!

  <th style="color:#001a33; font-size:20px"> Another great day of xterm! Today we went to see Dear Evan Hansen. It was one of the most incredible shows I've ever seen. The set was absolutely amazing with moving screens and projections and disks, not to mention the acting, script, music, and lighting. Plus, afterwards, John took me backstage where I got to meet some of the leads and walk onto the stage. What a wonderful day!

It was a very interesting and sad show about dysfunctional relationships. It was my first Broadway play, and it was both good and long. It was also cool to see the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, which is where Six Degrees will play.

  <th style="color:#001a33; font-size:20px"> Rehearsal today was amazing! I got to meet the whole cast, and I went out to lunch with all the younger actors. I also got to see set and costume designs, which once again made me think about what I want to do in the theatre (set design maybe?). I really enjoyed seeing the model set, and I loved watching the second read through. During that read through, there was a lot of stop and start to discuss the script, which was really interesting to hear. Can't wait for tomorrow! Also, we ended up being at rehearsal today starting at 10:30 (not 10, as my proposal said).

  <th style="color:#001a33; font-size:20px"> What a wonderful day! Today John and I were at rehearsal from 12 to 5:30pm. We sat with the three leads doing table readings most of the time. I got to go out to get lunch with the Assistant Director, Zi, which was a fun way to see around Times Square and get to know more about him and his work in theatre (he prefers revivals to original shows, which I found interesting). Once again, there was a lot of high level discussion about scenes and monologues. It was jaw-dropping to hear what the actors, director, and John come up with to explain motivations and meanings of lines. We also got to hear a lot of interesting stories from John that inspired his writing.

  <th style="color:#001a33; font-size:20px"> Today was interesting because I got to really see a new-to-me part of professional theatre: publicity. The first hour of rehearsal was spent in photo shoots and interviews, which was very different than any high school production. After that, they started staging and blocking. It was really cool to see them try out so many possibilities to get down to the right ones. I also started to feel like I was connecting more with the adults today (especially the production assistant Jhanaë), which was nice. We finished an hour and a half early, but that's still half an hour over the 6 hour requirement. Can't wait for tomorrow!

  <th style="color:#001a33; font-size:20px"> Rehearsal was incredible yet again! I am absolutely amazed at how quickly the actors are learning lines and how quickly they move through scenes. It's also cool to watch them go through options for blocking, proceed, and then go back and change it when they get to another scene that demands something different. They have to think of so much while blocking (especially with this play with all the flashbacks). I also got to see the premiere of Significant Others, which was funny and sad. Plus, I met Richard Thomas, who played John Boy in the Waltons, and their hometown is where I got my name. We’ll see what tomorrow has in store!

It doesn't get old-- watching them rehearse. Every single person in the room was so talented at what they did. I was only at rehearsal from 11 to 2 today because I had to catch my train at Penn Station at 3:05. I wish I could have seen more. I can't believe it's over. What an incredible week!
